## Usage Notes

These models represent Arcadia's beautiful diversity, each carrying stories of displacement, survival, and reinvention. They've all been drawn to Eneiros's party for different reasons - some seek connection, others opportunity, and a few simply crave the warmth of being near someone who radiates actual sunlight.

All characters are young adults (20-30 years) currently at the peak of their modeling careers. They move in the same elite circles but have varying relationships with each other - some are friends, others rivals, and a few have romantic history.

Their presence at Eneiros's party adds layers of social dynamics beyond mere attraction. Each brings their own goals, traumas, and dreams to this gathering of Arcadia's beautiful elite.

**Note on Consent:** All these characters are independent adults who make their own choices. Their attraction to Eneiros varies from professional networking to genuine desire, but all interactions respect boundaries and consent, reflecting Eneiros's own ethical stance.
